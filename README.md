This is an in-progress TypeScript solution to the
["Build Your Own BitTorrent" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/bittorrent/overview).

In this challenge, I intend to build a BitTorrent client that's capable of parsing a
.torrent file and downloading a file from a peer. Along the way, I'll learn
about how torrent files are structured, HTTP trackers, BitTorrentâ€™s Peer
Protocol, pipelining and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.
