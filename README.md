This is an in-progress TypeScript solution to the
["Build Your Own BitTorrent" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/bittorrent/overview).

In this challenge, I intended to build a BitTorrent client that's capable of parsing a
.torrent file and downloading a file from a peer. 

# Running and Pushing Changes

1. Ensure you have `bun` installed locally
2. Run `./your_bittorrent.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.ts`.
3. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters (or `git push public master` to publish to Github). Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
